# odin-to-do-list
Welcome! This is yet another JavaScript project in the JS part of TOP's NodeJS curriculum. This one is a to do list that will allow you to check tasks for a specific list, their title, the date in which they're due, their description, subtasks, etc. You can add new tasks and lists whenever you please.
